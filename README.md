# GazeCloud-plugin
 
Edited Lime Survey template in order to use the GazeCloudAPI (https://gazerecorder.com/gazecloudapi/) library to save eyetracking data from users taking a survey. Unfortunately, the demo has a time limit of 60s.

## Usage
Download the files, put them in a folder and copy it in `path-to-file...\LimeSurvey\themes\survey`

From the LimeSurvey theme editor (https://**site-name**.limesurvey.net/admin/themeoptions), press on "install". After that you can use it as a template.

_Todo_: save eye-tracking data and generate a heatmap from that.
